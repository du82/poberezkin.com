> Coding is hard but you still love it. But you also hate it, at least on some days.

> Humans are unpredictable so you chose to work with code and computers. But code outcomes are becoming increasingly unpredictable, and to succeed in coding you need to succeed with other humans.

> Open-source contribution is a complete waste of time. But it is also the best investment of time you can make to become a better engineer and it will also make you a better human being (maybe).
