> We have a single page application. It means that we have data models and we have to react to changes in these models. We also need to propagate data through the different parts of the application and to update views when data changes.

> There are quite a few frameworks that allow this on a basic level, but as the complexity of the application grows, the controller code becomes bloated with callbacks and glue code transferring data between models.

> With Milo framework it takes just a few lines of code to create a reactive data graph capable of propagating, transforming and validating data between models and views of any depth.

> In this talk we will explain the concepts and building blocks that make it possible, such as observable models, "DOM as data" and two-way data connectors. We will also build a simple TODO app and show how data-graph can be used in large-scale application architecture.
