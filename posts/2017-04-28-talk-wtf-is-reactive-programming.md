> This is a journey through the evolution of both the definition and implementations of Reactive Programming and how they have been converging in a quest to make building responsive applications a sane process.

> We are still at the point where there is no complete consensus on what a reactive application is; I will explore how this consensus is evolving and what problems it brings.

> I am going to talk about the past, present and possible futures of reactive programming and how you can survive it all.
