---

I am creator of [Ajv](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) JSON Schema validator, one of the most downloaded JavaScript libraries used by millions of developers - most modern web sites and applications depend on it.

I delivered secure enterprise-level distributed systems with high availability and data integrity in different industries - publishing, communications, advertising, etc...

I lead the technology team at [Threads](https://www.threadsstyling.com/) (@[threadsstyling](https://www.instagram.com/threadsstyling/)) - luxury chat-commerce business with a global reach.
We are providing the world's best luxury shopping experience.
